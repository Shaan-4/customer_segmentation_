# customer segmentation project
# 📊 Customer Personality Analysis & SegmentationProject OverviewThis project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning to segment a customer base of 2,240 individuals. By using K-Means Clustering, I identified four distinct customer personas based on their income and spending habits. This allows a business to move away from "one-size-fits-all" marketing and move toward targeted, data-driven strategies.The Technical PipelineData Cleaning: * Handled missing values in the Income column using median imputation.Removed non-informative features like ID, Z_CostContact, and Z_Revenue.Feature Engineering: * Derived Age from Year_Birth.Created Total_Spending by aggregating spending across all product categories (Wines, Fruits, Meat, etc.).Data Transformation: * Applied StandardScaler to normalize features. Since K-Means is a distance-based algorithm, scaling ensures that features with larger ranges (like Income) do not dominate those with smaller ranges (like Age).Optimization: * Utilized the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters ($K=4$), balancing model complexity with the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).Customer Profiles (Inferences)Based on the final clustering results, the customer base is divided into these four segments:Cluster 0: The "VIPs" (Top Right)Profile: High Income, High Spending.Strategy: Focus on loyalty programs and exclusive, high-ticket product launches.Cluster 1: The "Budget-Conscious" (Bottom Left)Profile: Low Income, Low Spending.Strategy: Targeted discounts and value-for-money promotions.Cluster 2: The "Aspirants" (Top Left)Profile: Low-to-Mid Income but High Spending.Strategy: These customers prioritize quality or status; use influencer marketing or trend-based campaigns.Cluster 3: The "Steady Base" (Mid Right)Profile: Mid-to-High Income, Moderate Spending.Strategy: Frequent engagement through newsletters to maintain consistent purchasing habits.Technologies UsedLanguage: Python 3.xLibraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SeabornMachine Learning: Scikit-Learn (K-Means, StandardScaler)
